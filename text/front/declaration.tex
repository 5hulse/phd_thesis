    This thesis comprises work solely conducted by me, except for the acquisition
    of the following experimental \acs{NMR} data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mohammadali Foroozandeh acquired the single chirp
            excitation data (\cref{fig:bbqchili-real}), and the
            datasets involving quinine (\cref{fig:quinine-cupid}) and camphor
            (\cref{fig:camphor-cupid}).
        \item Jonathan Yong acquired the datasets involving
            andrographoilde (\cref{fig:andro-onedim,fig:andrographolide-dosy}) and
            dexamethasone (\cref{fig:dexamethasone-cupid}).
        \item James Montgomery assisted me in acquiring the datasets
             involving 17\textbeta-estradiol (\cref{fig:estradiol-cupid}).
         \item The dataset involving cyclosporin A (\cref{fig:cyclosporin}) was
             sourced from \textsc{Bruker}'s \textsc{TopSpin} software (version
             4.0.8).
    \end{itemize}
    This work has not been submitted, either wholly or substantially, for any
    other qualification at this or any other institution.
