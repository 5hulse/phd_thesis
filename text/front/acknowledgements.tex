    % To begin, I would like to thank Dr Mohammadali Foroozandeh, by primary
    % supervisor for the majority of my PhD. It was truly an honour to be able to
    % discuss my work with him; his deep insights into a plethora of
    % topics in magnetic resonance is truly inspiring if a little daunting to
    % mortals like myself.
    % His passion for literature and music also rubbed off
    % on me. While they frequently had a rather violent
    % bent\,---\,Cormac McCarthy's \emph{Blood Meridian} and an opera by Alfred
    % Schnittke on Faust come to mind\,---\,I cannot say that his recommendations
    % were ever dull.

    % Prof. Timothy Claridge acted as my co-supervisor for most of my PhD. The
    % regular meetings on NMR that he hosted in the Chemistry Department were
    % very valuable to me, enabling me both to learn about how people were
    % applying NMR in their research, but also as it gave me countless
    % opportunities to present my work and other topics of interest.

    % Both Dr Foroozandeh and Prof. Claridge left the department during my PhD.
    % Dr Foroozandeh now works in qunatum computing at \textsc{Zurich
    % Instruments}, while Prof. Claridge is the director of a new NMR facility at
    % \textsc{Exscientia}. I wish them both the best with their new endeavours.

    % I am very grateful to Dr Fay Probert who agreed to be my supervisor for
    % the latter stages of my PhD, providing valuable advice and assistance. I'd
    % like to thank her and the rest of her group for welcoming me during my last
    % year.

    % Finally, I'd like to thank the \textsc{Royal Society} for generously
    % funding me during my studies.
