    To begin, I would like to thank Dr Mohammadali Foroozandeh, my primary
    supervisor for the majority of my PhD. It was truly an honour to be able to
    discuss my work with him; his deep insights into a plethora of
    topics in magnetic resonance is inspiring if a little daunting to
    mortals like myself. I am appreciative of his approach to supervision,
    allowing me to pursue interests further to my PhD work, even though it
    could be argued that I spent too much time learning about the Vim text
    editor and the Rust programming language.
    His passion for literature and music also rubbed off on me; while they
    frequently had a rather violent bent\,---\,Cormac McCarthy's \emph{Blood
    Meridian} and an opera by Alfred Schnittke on Faust come to mind\,---\,I
    cannot say that his recommendations were ever dull.
    It was a pleasure to be part of the Foroozandeh group; thanks to fellow
    members Jon, Jean-Baptise, Ali and David for the numerous discussions on
    pints over the years.
    I'd like to thank The Royal Society for generously
    funding me during my studies as part of Dr Foroozandeh's research stipend.

    Prof. Timothy Claridge acted as my co-supervisor for most of my PhD. The
    regular meetings on NMR that he hosted in the Chemistry Department were
    very valuable to me, both informing me on how people were
    applying NMR in their research, and giving me countless opportunities to
    present my work and other topics of interest.

    Both Dr Foroozandeh and Prof. Claridge left the department during my PhD.
    Dr Foroozandeh now works in qunatum computing at Zurich
    Instruments, while Prof. Claridge is the director of a new NMR facility at
    Exscientia. I wish them both the best with their new endeavours.

    I am very grateful to Dr Fay Probert who kindly agreed to be my supervisor
    for the latter stages of my PhD, providing valuable advice and assistance.
    I'd like to thank her and the rest of her group for being so welcoming to
    me during the last year of my PhD. James Montgomery was kind enough to
    support me with operating the departments NMR spectrometers, when I
    eventually decided I should acquire some of my own NMR data.

    During my 8 years both as an undergraduate and postgraduate student at
    Oxford, I met many wonderful people that made my time thoroughly enjoyable.
    To name a few, thanks to the 2015 Jesus College Chemists, Eve, Lauren,
    Ryan, Joe H, Caitlin, Jenyth, Dominic, Linda, Daniel, Valeria, Joe L, Nick,
    and Jim.  Most of all, I am immeasurably grateful to Isobel, for her
    support and all the wonderful memories; here's to many more to come!

    To my family\,---\,Mum, Dad, and (most of the time) Robert\,---\,your
    enduring love cannot be understated.
