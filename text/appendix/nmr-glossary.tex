\paragraph{Chemical Shift} The term chemical shift typically refers to the
resonance frequency of a nucleus relative to some standard frequency:
\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{\omega - \omega_{\text{ref}}}{\omega_{\text{ref}}}.
\end{equation}
The numerator and denominator are usually given in units of \unit{\hertz} and
\unit{\mega\hertz}, respectively. As such, the unit of the chemical shift is
\num{1e-6}, i.e. ``parts per million'' (\unit{\partspermillion}).
