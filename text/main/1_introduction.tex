\chapter{Introduction}

Since its conception almost 80 years ago, \ac{NMR} has become a ubiquitous
technique in chemistry, biochemistry and numerous other disciplines, thanks to
the unique insights into structure and dynamics it can provide. In this
chapter, after a very brief historical overview of the subject, an outline of
the basic theory behind the experiment -- without delving into the necessary
quantum mechanics for a truly formal account -- is given. Details of
the means by which the raw experimental data, the \ac*{FID} is produced, and its
structure, are given. Following on from this, an account is given of techniques
used to extract quantitative information from the \acs{FID}, which is the
central motivation of this work.
