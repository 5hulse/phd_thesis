\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{chap:intro}
This thesis is principally focussed on extracting quantitative information
from \ac{NMR} data. In this chapter, concepts are introduced to
contextualise the work undertaken.
After a brief introduction to \ac{NMR}, including key historical developments
and a simple description of its theoretical underpinnings, focus turns to
the form that \ac{NMR} data takes. The means by which the data is
conventionally processed and analysed to gain chemical insights is discussed.
Techniques used to estimate the parameters which describe \ac{NMR} data based
on a model of summed complex sinusoids are an alternative means of analysis.
While able to afford richer information than conventional
approaches, these are not widely employed, despite many effective
methods existing; a review of some of the most prominent methods ones is
given. Finally, the motivation for carrying out the work in this thesis is
discussed, and an overview of the remainder of its contents is provided.
