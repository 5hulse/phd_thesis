\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{chap:intro}
This thesis is principally focussed on extracting quantitative information
from \ac{NMR} data. In this first chapter, concepts are introduced to help
contextualise the work undertaken.
After a brief introduction to \ac{NMR}, including key historical developments
and a simple description of its theoretical underpinnings, focus turns to
the form that \ac{NMR} data takes. The means by which said data is
conventionally processed and analysed to gain chemical insights is discussed.
Techniques which estimate the parameters which describe \ac{NMR} data based on
a model of summed complex sinusoids are an alternate means of analysing
\ac{NMR} data. While able to afford richer information than conventional
approaches, these are not widely employed in \ac{NMR}, despite many effective
methods existing. A review of some of the most prominent ones are given.
Finally, the motivation for the project undertaken is discussed, and an outline of
the rest of the thesis is given.
