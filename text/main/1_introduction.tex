\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{chap:intro}
The primary theme of this thesis regards extracting quantitative information
from \ac{NMR} data. This chapter lays the groundwork to contextualise it. After
a brief introduction to \ac{NMR}, including key historical developments and a
simple description of its theoretical underpinnings, focus turns to
the form that \ac{NMR} data takes. The means by which the data is
conventionally processed to generate \ac{NMR} spectra, and subsequently
analysed to gain chemical insights, is discussed. Parametric estimation
estimation, while able to afford richer information about the data than
conventional approaches, are not widely employed in \ac{NMR}, despite many
effective methods existing. A review of some of the most prominent ones are
given. Finally, the motivation behind this work is given, along with an
overview of the subsequent chapters.
