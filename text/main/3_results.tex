\chapter{Results and Applications}

This chapter showcases numerous results generated using the estimation
technique outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:theory}. Sections \ref{sec:onedim} and
\ref{sec:twodim} focus on results generated on \ac{1D} and
\ac{2D} amplitude/phase-modulated paired datasets, respectively. The subsequent
three sections showcase three distinct applications that estimation
facilitates. In Section \ref{sec:pure-shift}, a means of generating broadband
homodecoupled (pure shift) spectra through estimation of hypercomplex \ac{2DJ}
datasets is provided. Section \ref{sec:seq} highlights how a standard \ac{1D}
estimation routine can be extended to datasets featuring a series of \acp{FID}
which feature attenuations in signal amplitudes across increments, such as
inversion recovery ($T_1$) and diffusion experiments. Finally, a protocol to
achieve ultra-broadband spectra through application of a single \ang{90}
frequency-swept pulse, which are devoid of quadratic phase dependencies as well
as severe baseline distortions, is provided. All the results and applications
presented here were acquired using the \ac{EsPy} package, which is described in
Chapter \ref{chap:nmrespy}. Relevant information on the setup of simulations
and experiments can be found in Appendix \ref{chap:datasets}. \note{Result
