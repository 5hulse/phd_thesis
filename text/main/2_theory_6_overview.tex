\section{Summary}
The \ac{MPM} is well established as an effective method for the parametric
estimation of signals in a number of disciplines.
One notable downside of the technique that has been realised while assessing
its effectiveness in parametrising \ac{NMR} \acp{FID} is its propensity to
return oscillators with unexpected phase behaviour, especially in scenarios
involving signals with similar frequencies, exhibiting considerable overlap in
the Fourier domain.
For this reason, using the result of the \ac{MPM} as an initial guess to feed
into a phase-variance regularised \ac{NLP} routine is proposed as a means of
returning improved parameter estimates. The theory underpinning the procedure
has been explored in this chapter.

The computational burden of running the procedure is large and often
insurmountable for complete \ac{NMR} datasets, which commonly comprise thousands of
points, and at least hundreds of contributing signals. Both the run time
and peak memory consumption of the \ac{1D} and \ac{2D} methods increase for \acp{FID} with more datapoints and more signals.
For this reason, a method to break the estimation problem into a
series of smaller, computationally tractable problems, through the construction
of frequency-filtered sub-\acp{FID}, has been introduced.

Algorithm \ref{alg:1d-2d-summary} provides an overview of the principal steps
involved in the \ac{1D} estimation procedure.

Having established an estimation routine, the next chapter focusses on its
performance in analysing \ac{1D} \ac{NMR} datasets. Furthermore, two specific
applications which arise from possession of the information afforded by
parametric estimation are described.
