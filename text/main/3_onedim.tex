\chapter{Results and Applications Involving 1D Estimation}
\label{chap:results}

This chapter showcases results generated using the \ac{1D} estimation
technique outlined in the previous chapter. Furthermore, two means by
which the \ac{1D} estimation procedure can be harnessed as part of
specific applications are presented.
\Cref{sec:evaluation} provides some examples of how the estimation
routine performs on \ac{1D} \ac{NMR} datasets acquired using a standard
pulse-acquire experiment. \Cref{sec:seq} illustrates how the basic \ac{1D}
estimation routine
can be extended to enable the consideration of datasets comprising a series of
\acp{FID} which feature attenuations in signal amplitudes across increments,
including inversion recovery and diffusion experiments. Finally,
\cref{sec:bbqchili} describes a protocol to generate ultra-broadband spectra
through application of a single \ang{90} \acl{FS} pulse, which are devoid of
quadratic phase dependencies as well as baseline distortions.

All the results presented were produced on the same computer (see
\cref{rem:workstation}), using the \ac{EsPy} package which is
described in \cref{chap:nmrespy}. Details about the datasets generated are
provided in \cref{chap:datasets}.
