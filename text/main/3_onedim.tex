\chapter{Results and Applications Involving 1D Estimation}
\label{chap:results}

This chapter showcases results generated using the \ac{1D} estimation
technique outlined in the previous chapter. Furthermore, two means by
which \ac{1D} estimation can be harnessed as part of
specific applications are presented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Cref{sec:evaluation} provides some examples of how the estimation
        routine performs in analysing \ac{1D} \ac{NMR} datasets acquired using
        a standard pulse-acquire experiment.
    \item \Cref{sec:seq} illustrates how the basic \ac{1D} estimation routine can be
        extended to enable the consideration of datasets comprising a series of
        \acp{FID} which feature attenuations in signal amplitudes across increments,
        including those from inversion recovery, \ac{CPMG}, and diffusion experiments.
    \item Finally,
        \cref{sec:bbqchili} describes a protocol to generate ultra-broadband spectra
        through application of a single \ang{90} \acl{FS} pulse, which are devoid of
        quadratic phase dependencies and baseline distortions.
\end{itemize}

All the results presented were generated using the \ac{EsPy} package,
described in \cref{chap:nmrespy}. Details about the datasets generated are
provided in \cref{chap:datasets}.
