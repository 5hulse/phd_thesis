\chapter{$1$D Results and Applications}
\label{chap:results}

This chapter showcases results generated using the \ac{1D} estimation
technique outlined in in the previous chapter. Furthermore, two means by
which the standard \ac{1D} estimation procedure can be extended for use in
specific applications are presented.

\Cref{sec:evaluation} provides some examples of how the estimation
routine performs on conventional \ac{1D} \acp{FID} (i.e. datasets akin to those
acquired using a pulse-acquire experiment). \Cref{sec:seq} illustrates
how the basic \ac{1D} estimation routine can be extended to enable the
consideration of datasets comprising a series of \acp{FID} which
feature attenuations in signal amplitudes across increments, including inversion
recovery and diffusion experiments. Finally, \cref{sec:bbqchili}
describes a protocol to generate ultra-broadband spectra through application of
a single \ang{90} \acl{FS} pulse, which are devoid of quadratic phase
dependencies as well as baseline distortions.

All the results presented were produced on the same computer (see
\cref{rem:workstation}), using the \ac{EsPy} package which is
described in \cref{chap:nmrespy}. Details about the datasets generated are
provided in \cref{chap:datasets}.
