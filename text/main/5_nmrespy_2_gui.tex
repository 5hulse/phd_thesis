Along with the \ac{EsPy} \ac{API}, an accompanying \ac{GUI} based on the
\textsc{Tkinter} toolkit ships with the
package. This can be accessed either via the command line, or within
\textsc{Bruker}'s \textsc{TopSpin} software to provide a more seamless workflow
in analysing \ac{NMR} data acquired on \textsc{Bruker} spectrometers.
At the time of writing, the \ac{GUI} only supports conventional \ac{1D}
and \ac{2DJ} datasets. Screenshots of the \acp{GUI} for both data types are
provided in \cref{fig:gui}.
The \ac{GUI} comprises two primary windows; the first enables the estimation
routine to be set up (panels a1 \& b1), while the second is for inspecting the
result (panels a2 \& b2). For the set-up window, the following actions are
carried out by the user:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{Pre-Processing} tab enables phase correction,
        application of exponential line-broadening\footnote{
            Exponential line-broadening is the only type of apodisation which
            is supported in \ac{EsPy}; use of any other window function
            would render the model used to fit the data incompatible.
            Line-broadening should only be applied in
            situations where the \ac{FID} is truncated, such that sinc wiggles
            are visible in the spectrum, as these will have an unwanted
            influence on filtered sub-\acp{FID} generated.
        }, and baseline correction. If the imported data has already been
        processed by some other software such as \textsc{TopSpin}\footnote{
            For \ac{1D} datasets, it is possible to import raw \ac{FID} data
            (\texttt{fid}) or processed spectral data (\texttt{1r}). If
            pre-processed data is imported, \ac{EsPy} performs \ac{IFT} and
            truncates the conjugate-symmetric signal generated in half to
            recover the \ac{FID}. For \ac{2DJ} data, it is necessary to import
            \ac{2DJ} data as a raw \ac{FID} (\texttt{ser}).
        }, this step can be skipped.
    \item Regions of interest and a region to determine the noise variance are
        specified with the \emph{Region Selection} tab. Panels a1 and b1 in
        \cref{fig:gui} provide illustrations of the appearance of the
        \ac{GUI} after a number of regions\,---\,each denoted by a coloured
        rectangle\,---\,have been defined by the user.
    \item \emph{Additional Setting} allows features related to the estimation
        routine to be customised, including whether to approximate the Hessian
        matrix or compute its exact form; whether to predict the model order
        using the \ac{MDL} or to manually specify a value; and setting a
        threshold for the maximum number of iterations allowed.
\end{itemize}

The result window effectively features a figure depicting the outcome of the
estimation routine, with a table of all the estimated parameters. For any
features in the result which the user deems to be erroneous, there is scope for
some basic edits to be made to be. Oscillators can be \emph{added} to the
result if a particular signal has been missed by the routine; they can be
\emph{removed} if they are deemed spurious; multiple oscillators can be
\emph{merged} if a particular signal is deemed to be over-fit; and a single
oscillator can be \emph{split} if more than one signal is deemed to be
under-fit. If any edits are requested by the user, the updated parameter set is
subjected to \ac{NLP} in order to reduce the bias in the result, and ensure
good agreement between the model and data is maintained. The ability to edit
the result can lead to better outcomes, since the user is able to guide the
optimiser using their expertise. The final stage in using the \ac{GUI}
involves specifying the formats to output the result to. Both figures and
parameter tables summarising the result can be exported to various formats. As
well as this, the estimator object which conducted everything under the hood
can be saved to a byte stream for future inspection.
