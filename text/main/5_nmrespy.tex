\chapter{Software}
\label{chap:nmrespy}

The estimation routine and applications emerging from it that have been
presented in the previous three chapters are accessible via the \ac{EsPy}
package. \ac{EsPy} aims to provide a feature-rich yet simple interface in order
perform estimation on datasets of interest. In this chapter, a short
overview of the package is given, along with the accompanying \ac{GUI}.
A rigorous description of the usage of \ac{EsPy}, including details on
installation, and a reference for the \ac{API} are given in the documentation
for \ac{EsPy}. The most up-to-date version of the documentation can be found
at:

    \item HTML: \url{https://foroozandehgroup.github.io/NMR-EsPy/}
    \item PDF: \note{???}
\end{itemize}
The source code for \ac{EsPy} is hosted on the Foroozandeh group's GitHub page
at \url{https://github.com/foroozandehgroup/NMR-EsPy}.
One chapter of the documentation, which provides tutorials on the basic usage
of \ac{EsPy} can be found in the appendix (Chapter \ref{chap:walkthrough}).
