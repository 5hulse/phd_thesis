\chapter{Software}
\label{chap:nmrespy}

The estimation routine and applications emerging from it that have been
presented in the previous two chapters are accessible via the \ac{EsPy}
package. \ac{EsPy} aims to provide a feature-rich yet simple interface in order
perform estimation on datasets of interest. In this chapter, a description of
the package is given, including the design choices, a basic description of the
package structure, and a description of the accompanying \ac{GUI}.

A rigorous description of the usage of \ac{EsPy}, including details on
installation, walkthroughs for different data types, and a reference for the
\ac{API} are given in the documentation for \ac{EsPy}. A hard-copy of the
version 2.0 documentation can be found in Section \note{TODO} of the Appendix.
