\chapter{2DJ Estimation for Pure Shift NMR}
\label{chap:cupid}
Two key features of the \ac{NMR} experiment for which improvements are
constantly being sought are sensitivity and resolving power.

    There are numerous means of enhancing sensitivity, such as the use of
    magnets with higher field strengths ($\operatorname{SNR} \propto
    B_0^{3/2}$)~\cite{Maeda2019} and cryogenic probes~\cite{Kovacs2020}, as
    well as simply increasing the number of transients ($\operatorname{SNR}
    \propto N_{\text{t}}^{1/2}$)~\cite[Section 5.2]{Levitt2007}.

However, few means of achieving better resolution exist beyond increased field
strengths (resolution $\propto B_0$), and ensuring that a magnetic
field with a high degree of homogeneity is used through the use of shimming.
Significant interest has therefore
been given to the development of techniques which generate broadband homodecoupled
(\emph{pure shift}) spectra, in which the effects of homonuclear scalar
couplings are absent from the data. While often valuable for structural
assignment purposes, the influence of scalar couplings can lead to spectra
which are too crowded for meaningful insights to be gleaned. While it is
commonplace to decouple heteronuclear couplings at the point of \ac{FID}
acquisition~\cite{Shaka1983a, Shaka1983b,Shaka1985}, homonuclear decoupling is
far more challenging. At the time of writing, there are a number of approaches
for acquiring pure shift spectra; the most popular modern approach
involves running a suitable \ac{2D} pulse sequence, and concatenating the initial
sections of each \ac{FID}, in a process referred to as
\emph{chunking}~\cite{Meyer2013,Adams2014,Zangger2015}. The key drawback of all of
these techniques is that the resultant pure shift signal is considerably less
sensitive relative to a standard pulse-acquire experiment, since only a
fraction of the available spin magnetisation contributes to that which is
incorporated into the dataset.

In this chapter, a method for deriving pure shift spectra indirectly via the
estimation of \ac{2DJ} datasets is presented, which has been named
\acfi{CUPID}. It is illustrated that by extracting the parameters which
describe a \ac{2DJ} dataset, a pure shift spectrum with desirable
absorption-mode lineshapes can be produced without the signal loss associated
with experimental pure shift methods.
