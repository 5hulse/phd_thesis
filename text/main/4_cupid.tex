\chapter{Pure shift spectra from 2D J-resolved estimation}
\label{chap:cupid}
Two key features of the \ac{NMR} experiment for which improvements are
constantly being sought are sensitivity and resolving power. There are numerous
means of enhancing sensitivity, such as the use of magnets with higher field
strengths\cite{Maeda2019} (sensitivity $\propto B_0^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}$) and
cryogenic probes\cite{Kovacs2020}, as well as simply
increasing the number of scans (sensitivity $\propto
\operatorname{NS}^{\nicefrac{1}{2}}$).
\note{There is a limitation to this: can't find the paper on it though}.
However, few means of achieving better resolution exist beyond increased field
strengths (resolution $\propto B_0$). Significant interest has therefore been
given to the development of techniques which generate broadband homodecoupled
(\emph{pure shift}) spectra, in which the effects of homonuclear scalar
couplings are absent from the data. While often valuable for structural
assignment purposes, the influence of scalar couplings can lead to spectra
which are too crowded for meaningful insights to be gleamed. While it is
commonplace to decouple heteronuclear couplings at the point of \ac{FID}
acquisition\cite{Shaka1983a, Shaka1983b,Shaka1985}, homonuclear decoupling is
far more challenging. At the time of writing, there are a number of of
well-established pure shift experiments, which involve running a \ac{2D} pulse
sequence, and concatenating the initial sections of each \ac{FID}, in a process
referred to as ``chunking''\cite{Meyer2013,Adams2014,Zangger2015}. The key
drawback of all of these techniques is that the resultant pure shift signal is
considerably less sensitive relative to a standard pulse-acquire experiment,
since only a fraction of the available spin magnetisation contributes that
which is detectable by the probe.

In this chapter, a method for deriving pure shift spectra indirectly via the
estimation of \ac{2DJ} datasets is presented, named \acfi{CUPID}. It is
illustrated that by extracting the
parameters which describe a \ac{2DJ} dataset, a pure shift spectrum can be
produced without the signal loss associated with all experimental pure shift
methods, and with desirable absorption-mode lineshapes.
