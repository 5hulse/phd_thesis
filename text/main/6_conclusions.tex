\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Re-write more intensive parts (matrix pencil/NLP) in a low-level
        compiled language like Rust/C++
    \item NMR-EsPy provides a nice API in order to be used as a general
        platform to run and assess various estimation routines: implement other
        estimation routines into the package.
    \item Allow constraints to be incorporated into the NLP routine (Constrain
        amplitudes/frequency separations for oscillators known to be associated
        with multiplet structures).
    \item 2D amp-modulated and phase-modulated datasets? Filtering procedure
        currently used requires spectra devoid of sinc wiggles, hence need to
        be damped sufficiently. Indirect-dimension FIDs often truncated, so
        extreme exp damping commonly required. This leads to poor resolution
        and broader peaks also require wider regions for filtering to be
        effective. Possibly necessary to use some other form of apodisation
        (resolution enhancement like sine-bell, Gaussian), and adjust the model
        for estimation to accommodate this.
