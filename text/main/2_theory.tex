\label{chap:theory}

This chapter provides a description of the theory behind an estimation
routine which has been developed for the consideration of time-domain \ac{NMR}
data~\cite{Hua1991,Lin1997,Nocedal2006}\label{corr:prev-work}.
In essence, the routine consists of generating a parameter estimate using the
\ac{SVD}-based \ac{MPM}, which is fed to an iterative \ac{NLP} routine to
produce the final result. The \ac{MPM} is employed to form an initial
guess of parameters, while the \ac{NLP} routine behaves as a means of validation,
by attempting to make the parameter estimate consistent with
known features of the data. The technique can be thought of as a compromise
between ``black-box methods''~\cite{Poullet2008} which require little to no
prior knowledge about the data, and iterative methods like \ac{VARPRO} and
\ac{AMARES}, which require vast amounts of user input, but are typically
able to estimate complex datasets more effectively.
Furthermore, after profiling the run time and memory consumption of the
technique, a method for producing filtered \acp{FID}, featuring a subset of the
signals and (optionally) fewer datapoints relative to the full \ac{FID} is
presented, which can drastically reduce the burden on computational resources
in carrying out the estimation procedure.
