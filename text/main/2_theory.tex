\chapter{Theory}
\label{chap:theory}

This chapter provides a description of the theory behind an estimation
routine which has been developed for the consideration of time domain \ac{NMR}
data.
In brief, the routine consists of generating a parameter estimate using the
\ac{SVD}-based \ac{MPM}, followed by the application of a \ac{NLP} routine to
produce a final result. The \ac{MPM} is employed to generate an initial
guess of parameters, while the \ac{NLP} routine behaves as a ``sanity
check''\note{better phase?} by attempting to make the parameter estimate more consistent with
known features of the data. The technique can be thought of as a compromise
between ``black-box'' methods which require little to no prior knowledge about
the data, and iterative methods like \ac{VARPRO} and \ac{AMARES}, which require
vast amounts of prior knowledge, but are typically able to estimate
complex datasets more effectively.

Furthermore, after profiling the run time and memory consumption of the
technique, a method for producing filtered \acp{FID}, featuring fewer signals
and (optionally) datapoints is presented, which can drastically reduce the
burden on computational resources.

Outlines of relevant algorithms and \Python implementations are
provided to supplement this chapter. As well as those present
within this chapter, more algorithms can be found in \cref{sec:algs}, while
\Python implementations can be found in \cref{chap:code-listings}.
