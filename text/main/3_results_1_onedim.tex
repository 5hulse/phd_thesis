In order to assess the estimation routine proposed in Chapter \ref{chap:theory}
-- specifically the effectiveness of applying \ac{NLP} using an initial guess
generated using the \ac{MPM} -- a series of synthetic \acp{FID} were constructed
using \eqref{eq:hypercomplex-fid} with $D=1$. For each \ac{FID}, a model order
of $M=20$ was used, the number of points sampled was $\None = 1024$, the sweep
width was $\fswone=\qty{125}{\hertz}$, and the transmitter offset was $\foffone
= \qty{0}{\hertz}$.  Each oscillator was assigned a phase of \ang{0}, while the
amplitudes, frequencies and damping factors were drawn at random from the
following distributions:
$\bdam \sim \mathcal{U}(1, 5)$, $\bdfonem \sim \mathcal{U}(\qty{-55}{\hertz},
\qty{55}{\hertz})$, $\bdetaonem \sim \mathcal{U}(\qty{2}{\per\second},
\qty{8}{\per\second})\ \forall m \in \lbrace 0, \cdots, 19\rbrace$. An extra
constraint was applied to the frequencies,
such that no two oscillators were permitted to have frequencies that differed
by less than $\nicefrac{4 \fswone}{\None} \approx \qty{0.49}{\hertz}$. Each
noiseless \ac{FID} was then corrupted with \ac{AWGN}, with a target \ac{SNR} of
\qty{25}{\deci\bel}\note{Reference that this is the lowest
SNR that the MPM considered to be effective}. The spectra of the simulated
\acp{FID} are presented in panel a of Figure \ref{fig:mpm_vs_nlp}, with the set
of true oscillator peaks in panel b.

For each \ac{FID}, the \ac{MPM} was performed, assuming that the model order is
30, constituting a considerable over-fit. The \ac{MDL} tended to produce
considerable under-estimates of $M$ are these \acp{FID}, so a hard-coded value
was used instead. Simulated signals featuring \ac{AWGN} typically show a
clean division between signal and noise components\note{better way of
describing this?}, with noise components
commonly being characterised by small amplitudes and/or very small damping
factors. For this reason, prior to subjecting the \ac{MPM} result to \ac{NLP},
oscillators which satisfied either $\bdam < 0.1$ or  $\bdetaonem <
\qty{0.7}{\per\second}$ were removed from the parameter set. The individual
oscillators which make up the \ac{MPM} result after purging noise components
are displayed in panel c of Figure \ref{fig:mpm_vs_nlp}, along with the
residual between the data and the summation of all the oscillator peaks (the
model).


The \ac{MPM} invariably generates a model with good agreement with the data, as
evidenced by the residual.
However, it can be seen that in several spectral regions across the datasets,
especially ones that are highly crowded, oscillators possess parameters which
deviate significantly from the true parameters, with the most notable feature
being individual oscillator phases -- these regularly stray far from \ang{0} --
and their associated amplitudes. The central motivation behind employing phase
variance-regularised \ac{NLP} is as a means of attempting to overcome this
detrimental feature of the \ac{MPM}.
In panel c of Figure \ref{fig:mpm_vs_nlp}, the blue oscillators are those which
agree very closely with a particular oscillator in the true set of parameters.
Oscillators with other colours are not clearly mapped to a true oscillator,
with the different colourings described shortly.
The intention is for the \ac{NLP} routine to adjust the parameters describing
the non-blue oscillators in panel c such that they agree with oscillators found
in the true set, while not affecting the blue oscillators.
The results of \ac{NLP} at convergence ($\epsilon = \num{1e-8}$) are provided
in panel d.

In discussing the outcome of the routine, it will be useful to introduce the
concept of a \emph{frequency neighbourhood}, a loose term which describes a
small, continuous range of frequencies within the spectral window. As the
\ac{NLP} routine involves taking small steps
through parameter space in an attempt to converge, it is unlikely that an
oscillator which starts off with a frequency far away from a particular
frequency neighbourhood will eventually enter it.  As such, in order for the
\ac{NLP} routine to successfully estimate the region, sufficient oscillators
need to present within the neighbourhood in the first place. Cases where the
\ac{MPM} generated enough oscillators for a given frequency neighbourhood,
albeit with parameters which are noticeably off the true parameters are in
either green or yellow. Green oscillators are those which the \ac{NLP} routine
was able to adjust in order to achieve agreement with the true result. As such,
they indicate improvements to the estimation result as opposed to the \ac{MPM}
being used by itself. Conversely, yellow oscillators denote cases where, though
sufficient oscillators exists in the frequency neighbourhood in the initial
guess, the \ac{NLP} routine evolves such that at least one of the oscillators
is driven by the phase variance constraint to acquire a negative amplitude,
such that it is purged from the parameter set. This typically occurs when an
oscillator has an initial phase which is considerably greater than \ang{90}.
Yellow oscillators therefore indicate cases where the final result has
under-fit the dataset. There are a few instances, denoted by red oscillators,
where the \ac{MPM} assigned too few oscillators to a particular frequency
region, and as such the \ac{NLP} would not have been able to yield any
improvement.
The final two oscillator groupings, denoted by purple and orange, denote cases
where the \ac{MPM} generated more oscillators than are present in a given
frequency neighbourhood (i.e. the data was over-fit in this region). Orange
oscillators we purged by the \ac{NLP} routine due to their acquiring negative
amplitudes. This enabled a parsimonious fit of th frequency neighbourhood by
the oscillators which remained. Finally, the purple oscillators denote the one
occasion where an over-fit occurred, and the model order was not successfully
reduced by the \ac{NLP} routine.

Overall, it can be seen that the inclusion of \ac{NLP} broadly improves the
output of the \ac{MPM}, where crowded regions often get assigned oscillators
with spurious complex amplitudes ($a$ and  $\phi$). \note{More discussion here...}

Figure \ref{fig:andro-onedim} illustrates the outcome of applying the
estimation routine to selected regions of a \textsuperscript{1}H dataset of
andrographolide (Figure \ref{fig:structures}.e), in \acs{DMSOd6}. The \ac{NLP}
routine is effective at resolving the spurious phase-behaviour often generated
by the \ac{MPM}, while retaining reasonable fits to the data in most
circumstances. It's ability to estimate parameters from resonances with high
dynamic range is also evidenced by the fact that it was able to assign an
intense, broad singlet, corresponding to water which has entered the sample
over time, alongside a nearby quartet corresponding to the methylene of some
residual ethanol in the sample.

Probably the most challenging aspect of estimating \ac{NMR} signals is
the fact that data frequently contains signals with incredibly
similar frequencies, commonly due to the effect of scalar couplings. Molecules
with fused ring systems such as andrographolide are prime examples of spin
systems which generate such datasets, as they tend to have very dense coupling
networks, and often exhibit appreciable long-range couplings (between spins
separated by four or more bonds) alongside more prevalent two-bond (geminal)
and three-bond (vicinal) couplings. Take the multiplet structure from spin (Q)
as an example.
This nucleus has separate 3-bond (vicinal) couplings to the
diastereotopic protons (M) and (N), which are likely the greatest magnitude couplings
associated with (Q). If these were the only couplings, a doublet of doublets
(dd) structure would be expected, which is what has been fit by
the estimation routine (see panel c in the region of
\SIrange{1.85}{1.88}{\partspermillion}). However, a
comparison of the data and the model indicates that there is clear discrepancy
between the two, evidenced by systematic ``wobbles'' in the residual. An
under-fit of the multiplet structure is therefore apparent. For comparison,
note that the \ac{MPM} generated oscillators with phases deviating far from
\ang{0} in order to agree as closely as possible to the data, however such a
set of oscillators is unrealistic for a well-phased \ac{FID}. Four-bond couplings with
magnitudes that are large enough to influence the appearance of (Q)'s
multiplet structure must therefore be present. Similar scenarios are apparent for spins
(P) and (V), which from a cursory inspection appear to comprise triplet of
doublets (dt) and quartet of doublets (dq) multiplet structures, respectively\footnote{
    The major couplings associated with (P) are a geminal coupling to (O), a vicinal
    coupling to (V) with a dihedral angle of \ang{180}, and another vicinal coupling to
    (R), with a dihedral angle of \ang{60}. The (O) and (V) couplings are
    likely of similar magnitude, giving rise to the apparent triplet structure,
    with the (R) coupling being smaller, based on the Karplus equation\note{CITE}.
    For (V), a geminal coupling to (R), and vicinal couplings to (W) and (P),
    both with \ang{180} dihedral angles, lead to the apparent quartet
    structure, with a smaller vicinal coupling to (O).

, but which
again have far more complex coupling structures due to the presence of small
four-bond couplings.
